# New vim config

Trying to re-build my vim config from scratch so that :
* It finally works smoothly with TS
* I understand what I install, what is going on, etc...
* I get an even better experience

## Step by step

### First step

**Get back to my usual shortcuts**

* Using jk (and kj) instead of escape to quit insert mode
* Disable arrows

### 2. Install vim-plug

Need some plugins...

### 3. Add some indentation rules

Spaces over tabs
4 spaces by default
